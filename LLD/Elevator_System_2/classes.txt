Relations:

Building has a one-to-many relationship with Floor and ElevatorController. This means a Building can have multiple Floor and ElevatorController instances. It also has a one-to-one relationship with ExternalDispatcher.

ElevatorController has a one-to-one relationship with ElevatorCar, DispatchStrategy, and InternalButtons. This means an ElevatorController has one ElevatorCar, one DispatchStrategy, and one InternalButtons.

ElevatorCar has a one-to-one relationship with ElevatorDoor. This means an ElevatorCar has one ElevatorDoor.

InternalButtons has a one-to-one relationship with ElevatorController. This means InternalButtons is associated with one ElevatorController.

ExternalButtons has a one-to-one relationship with ExternalDispatcher. This means ExternalButtons is associated with one ExternalDispatcher.

DispatchStrategy is an abstract base class for NearestElevatorStrategy and EvenOddStrategy. This means both NearestElevatorStrategy and EvenOddStrategy inherit from DispatchStrategy.

ExternalDispatcher has a one-to-many relationship with ElevatorController and a one-to-one relationship with DispatchStrategy. This means an ExternalDispatcher can be associated with multiple ElevatorController instances and one DispatchStrategy.

Floor has a one-to-one relationship with ExternalButtons. This means a Floor is associated with one ExternalButtons.
